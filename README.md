# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course
Project Name: ProjectMaster

## Summary

ProjectMaster is an AI-driven platform designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of project management and knowledge sharing within JCI and other project-based organizations. By leveraging AI, the platform will analyze past projects, identify best practices, and facilitate the dissemination of knowledge to improve the planning and execution of new projects. Additionally, ProjectMaster will focus on ensuring that every project has the potential to do good and make a positive impact on the community and the world.


## Background

This is a common issue in project-based organizations, where project teams often work in silos, and valuable insights from past projects are not easily accessible. This challenge is exacerbated by the time constraints faced by members who participate in these projects as a hobby. Many organizations, including JCI, have a wealth of experience from numerous past projects but struggle to effectively learn from and disseminate this knowledge. This results in repeated mistakes, inefficiencies, and missed opportunities for improvement. The ProjectMaster aims to centralize and analyze project data to provide actionable insights and foster a culture of continuous improvement. Moreover, it will emphasize projects that contribute to the greater good, helping communities and addressing global challenges.


## How is it used?

The platform is used by project managers and team members within JCI and similar organizations. It can be accessed via a web interface, where users can search for insights, view recommendations, and collaborate on projects. Users can also filter projects by their community impact and find inspiration for initiatives that contribute to societal good.

## Affected people

* Project managers looking for best practices and lessons learned
* Team members seeking guidance on how to execute tasks more effectively
* Organizational leaders aiming to improve overall project success rates
* Community members benefiting from projects designed to do good


## Data sources and AI methods

* Historical project reports and documentation
* Feedback and evaluations from past projects
* Meeting notes and communications
* Project management tools (e.g., Trello, Asana)
* Community impact reports and social responsibility metrics

Natural Language Processing (NLP): To extract key insights from project documentation and communications.
Machine Learning: To identify patterns and best practices from past projects.
Knowledge Graphs: To map relationships and connections between different projects and their outcomes.
Sentiment Analysis: To gauge the positive impact and community feedback on past projects.
Demo Implementation: A prototype could be developed using Python, with libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning, and NLTK or spaCy for NLP. The system could be integrated with project management tools via their APIs to collect data automatically. Additionally, tools like BERT or GPT could be used for sentiment analysis.

## Challenges

* Data Privacy: Ensuring that sensitive project data is handled securely.
* Data Quality: The accuracy and completeness of historical project data can vary.
* User Adoption: Encouraging members to use the platform and contribute their knowledge.
* Impact Measurement: Quantifying the positive impact of projects can be complex.

## What next?

Enhanced Analytics: Adding predictive analytics to foresee project risks and outcomes.
Collaboration Tools: Integrating with communication platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams for real-time collaboration.
Mobile App: Developing a mobile version of the platform for on-the-go access.
Impact Metrics: Developing standardized metrics for measuring the social and community impact of projects.
